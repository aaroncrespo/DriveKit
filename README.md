# DriveKit

> **Note**: This was written to scratch own itch. There are probably better ways to handle CocoaPods and Carthage as a Library. If you find a use for this and would like to help make it better checkout [GTMAppAuth issue](https://github.com/google/GTMAppAuth/issues/24) or help make this project better with pull requests.


What is this:

Working on a project which uses `Carthage`, but google drive services and google auth both use `CocoaPods` as a Library builder/generator which. I would also prefer to not have have my project mix and match `CocoaPods` and `Carthage`

This is a simple Carthage compatible project used to isolate the `CocoaPods` consuming code from a containing project.


## Requirements

hopefully: none

## Installation

Installed via `git submodule`, `Carthage` or ~~pod 'DriveKit'~~ once use whatever means you prefer to add as a depenency to a project

Note: this is not a public podspec because im not sure about name collissions or redistribution issues.
